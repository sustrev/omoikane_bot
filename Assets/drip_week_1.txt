Orientation day. Since she already lived at HQ, she didn’t have to wait at the gate with the other initiates. Instead, she waited in the classroom, already in uniform, already with her phone and tablet and identification badge and giant vat of coffee. [F1 1/7]
She wasn’t sure how well this would go over with the others. Would they have already made connections outside the gate? Would they avoid sitting by her, since she was obviously the odd one out? Would they think she was a plant, or some remedial student on their second round of orientation? [F1 2/7]
She sat there, staring at her coffee, trying not to react as the other initiates filed in and took their seats… nobody sitting next to her… until *him.* [F1 3/7]
“Hey, I’m Quentin. You seem like you know what you’re doing around here.” He held out his hand. [F1 4/7]
“...Felicity.” She took it with a confidence she didn’t feel. “Nice to meet you. I’ve only been here a few days, but I don’t get lost on the way to the Commissary, at least.” [F1 5/7]
Quentin grinned. “Perfect. I could tell you were someone I needed to know.” [F1 6/7]
Felicity smiled back as their supervisor called them to attention and led them through their first day as Bureau employees. She was pretty sure that Quen had *terrible* taste of allies, *clearly*, but if he was willing to team up…  for now, she’d take it. [F1 7/7]
Did you know… the living and the dead typically use different gates? Living-gates, like the liminal hallway at Headquarters, are provided by Customs and are utilized by Bureau members and authorized guests via tethers. Gates for the newly deceased are managed by Extrans teams for efficient and comfortable transport and transitioning. The Afterlife is inevitable, but providing such services keeps everything running optimally!
Remember to stay in uniform! Your uniform signals to others that you have an important job here at the Bureau. By adhering to department color codes and professional attire standards, we make sure the Bureau is always well-represented!
When riding on the Afterlife transit system, please be courteous to other passengers. Remember that you represent the Bureau and all it has to offer!
You know that saying, "if you want something done right, do it yourself"? Well, sometimes that wasn't an option. Sometimes, you had to watch from the sidelines and hope that things turned out okay. [M1 1/17]
There were going to be times when it might not get done the way *you* wanted it to be done, but at least it was getting done with a high chance of success. Now, that was all fine and dandy, but… sometimes, it was a bit much when she thought of who she'd left in charge. [M1 2/17]
Did she trust them with the fate of the world? …yes. Did she trust them to be nice to other worlds in the process? Absolutely goddamn not. She wasn't surprised by the report she got. So… what now? Sit back and hope they'd be *nicer* next time? [M1 3/17]
Laughable. They'd save their world because they wanted to keep living in it. Those other worlds? They should be thankful they even had a chance of survival. [M1 4/17]
But Mae wanted to give them *more* than just a chance at survival. She wanted to give them hope for a better future, for a *longer* future, more than getting past this singular apocalypse. [M1 5/17]
The entity that took them for all those months, kept them in an entirely different dimension, and now is opening new doors into other worlds for them… She knew most of her friends wanted to banish it, or even completely destroy it if such a thing were possible. [M1 6/17]
And it was likely that they'd succeed, unless they got distracted by some other mission. Once they were done collecting an unknown number of quest items, it was likely they'd waltz back into the place and end any possibility of the entity maintaining a connection to their world… but *other* worlds may not be so lucky. [M1 7/17]
She wasn't entirely sure what she was doing until she *did* it… but when she opened her eyes, she stood in one of the rooms described to her during the report of the battle. The… vestibule, one of them had called it. She'd entered the place on *her* terms. [M1 8/17]
It took her a bit of searching, but when one's teleportation is based on belief, she didn't *have* to follow the entity's pathways exactly as written. She *knew* about the existence of the original House, about the strange lacuna… and with enough effort, she'd make it work. [M1 9/17]
She reached out to touch the odd structure, and a hand grabbed her wrist. "What do you think you're doing here?" the old man asked as she pulled away. [M1 10/17]
"I want to help. There are other worlds out there, other people who deserve a chance. Even once the Enemy of Light is resealed… that'll only prevent *one* end of the world. I want to help *keep* those worlds intact." [M1 11/17]
"ANOTHER LITTLE LIGHT PERSON?" a voice bellowed. "STRANGE. YOU WANT TO CHAIN YOURSELF TO A LIFE OF FIGHTING THE INEVITABLE? TO STRUGGLE AGAINST ME, AND THOSE LESSER THAN ME, FOR THE REMAINDER OF YOUR SHORT MORTAL LIFE?" [M1 12/17]
Mae nodded. "In a way, yes. I want to be able to go where is needed, like how this place can open doors to where the others need to go to complete *your* request." She pauses thoughtfully. "It would mean this entity could maintain its connections with other worlds, instead of losing them to their destruction. There can be no more doors to a universe that no longer exists… can there?" [M1 13/17]
"YOUR LOGIC IS UNSOUND. YOU DARE TO CONTINUE?" Mae nodded. "If it's possible, I would like the ability to go to new worlds, where they are on the brink of an apocalyptic event but it is not yet guaranteed, so that I may attempt to help them." [M1 14/17]
"IT WILL BE A PRISON OF YOUR OWN CREATION, LITTLE LIGHT PERSON. IT WILL NOT BE WITHOUT RISK, NOR WITHOUT PAIN." [M1 15/17]
"I understand, and I am aware that what I ask will not be granted to me unconditionally. I ask anyway." Her resolve unwavering, she continued. "Even if not with this entity, I *will* find a way. If it does *not* help me, I will travel to new worlds and banish this entity from every world I find. If it *does*… I will not interfere." [M1 16/17]
"PECULAR. I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING ADDITIONAL WORLDS TO END, WHEN IT IS TIME. IT IS NOT YET TIME." The voice seemed to bring an end to the conversation, but not before… "AND TELL THOSE OTHER LIGHT PERSONS TO NOT DELAY THEIR OWN TASK." [M1 17/17

She'd lost track of how many times it had happened. She'd lose her temper, things would break, and then… it was over. It wasn't even her fault this time, that kid had *completely* deserved a scare, not her fault that she was karma's mistress. Terrible luck that it was some nephew of whoever-the-fuck. [J1 1/10]
When you'd been bounced to as many homes as she had, learning names made less and less sense. They were all temporary. They'd take her and her sister in, cooing about how *they're* not like the others, that they're great with "troubled" kids like her, that she can make herself at home. Then, months or weeks - or, at least once, *days* - later, they'd come to their senses and send her packing. [J1 2/10]
Sometimes, they'd try to extend the offer to stay to her sister. She was good with watching the littles, so it was like having free parenting help. They wanted *her* to stay… and who could blame them for trying? Who could blame her if she'd taken them up on it, traded her delinquent sister for a comfy bed and warm meals? You did what you have to do to survive. [J1 3/10]
But every time - *every* time - her sister would be right there with her. Bags already packed, her sister would whisk her away to the nearest fast food joint with halfway decent nuggets. She'd pull out whatever money she'd managed to squirrel away, claim a table, and send a text to their case worker. `Feel free to try again.` [J1 4/10]
And Jess would stare at her sister, her one permanent safe thing in this godforsaken hellhole of a planet, as she inhaled those golden chunks of processed comfort food. [J1 5/10]
It was the same whenever she'd find herself running afoul of the law, which happened more often than it didn't. New kids in the neighborhood were often eyed with suspicion, especially when their reputation preceded them. Sometimes she *was* at fault. Other times, somebody else recognized that they could easily blame their petty crimes on her and play innocent. [J1 6/10]
No matter what, her sister was there, talking down whatever asshole with a badge was on the case. Her sister had been good with talking to adults for as long as she could remember. It wasn't always magical, but armed jackasses always got an extra heaping dose of compulsion, just to be safe. [J1 7/10]
This time, however… her sister was two weeks from 18. About to age out of the system, with younger Jess still held captive. Unlikely that the state would let them stay together, since they had no home, no family, no money… If it was up to a human to make the final call, they probably could have conned their way through. But it was a computer system, with hard checks and a lengthy exceptions process. [J1 8/10]
So… they ran. She got her comfort food to go, and they did their best to stay out of sight until they could figure things out. It may not have been the wisest decision, but it was hard to think rationally when “separation” was a possibility. [J1 9/10]
Then, when opportunity knocked… when a voice told them that they could stay together, her sister could work, she could finish her schooling… they'd have a place to stay, food to eat, money to spend… of *course* they agreed. Besides, they could always slip away again if it didn't work out, right? [J1 10/10]
