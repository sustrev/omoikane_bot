## Credits
Much of this bot is created specifically for Monte Cook's Cypher system. This bot is meant to take the place of a basic VTT environment, so that games can be played solely on Discord. This bot is *not* meant to take place of supporting Monte Cook by purchasing a copy of the playbook. Therefore, I have purposely avoided providing features that would negate the necessity of the book during character creation and leveling up. Please visit [Monte Cook Games](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/cypher-system-rulebook-2/) to purchase your own copy, if you haven't already; it's integral to understanding the game utility features this bot provides.
